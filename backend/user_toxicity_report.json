It was a tragic event without a doubt, but all facts point to proper measures taken by the officers on scene (not to mention the fact that two officers had picked him up an hour prior to the incident and drove him home).

Yes they have problems, and they do have undeveloped areas with similar problems to Afghanistan, but it is a very small percentage of the population.  There is an rivalry with India, but in truth Pakistan has historically aligned more with the US than India. Finally, we cannot solve their problems, only they can. We can aid them in that, but the initiative and main actions have to be their own.",

Cook was welcomed with open arms because Hawaiians and Polynesians generally were voyagers par excellence.  They celebrated voyagers and made them feel at home when they made landfall.  How else could their ancestors have settled every landmass over 1/3 of the globe?  Xenophobia would have been counter-productive to this enterprise, don't you think?  Kamehameha actively sought alliance with King George of England, and he and others spoke of themselves as men of Brittanee.  Through much of the 19th century Hawai`i had one of the greatest rates of literacy in the world, and the local newspapers were filled with stories about goings-on around the world.  These were some of the least xenophobic people in the world for a long time.\n\n(continued)",

Second, at no point does the Property Clause or Article 1, Section 8 prohibit the government from owning land. If you can find the spot where it says, \"the government can own no land except this one little bit\" please feel free to enlighten the countless Constitutional scholars and Supreme Court (and lesser) judges who disagree with you.",

But if government does not significantly shrink, it will continue to stifle business with over regulation and bleed the life out of businesses and citizens through all forms of taxes, user fees, and government revenue schemes. There will be no growing the economy after the reset of a crash if our huge per capita Gov. just continues to suck the life out of any possible economic growth. Small Gov. everybody wins if they invest during the crash. Big Gov. anybody who invests hard money even when properties are giveaway prices is foolish. It's too bad Gov. grew well funded and well manned for 40 years on big oil money. It has matured into something working Alaskans neither want nor can afford.",

A person who is anti-choice can't possibly advance the agenda for women.

No mention that Clapper was guilty of perjury in previous testimony on CIA files on ordinary Americans and it was his lies that led to Edward Snowden becoming a whistleblower. He should have bounced from office in disgrace; instead he has been given a second act as a Barack Obama War Party propagandist.  The bottom line is that the Democratic National Party disgraced itself in the election campaign, the Clintons disgraced themselves over there entire careers and the Wikileaks e-mails exposed them. Whether the leaks came from Russian hackers, which Assange and UK ambassador Craig Murray both deny, or from a disgruntled Democratic Party worker, as Assange and Murray maintain, the leaks helped rather than hurt American democracy. They kept the criminal Clintons from an odious third term in the White House by properly informing the American public of their foul misdeeds.",

He hated rodeos and used to say: \"Dammit, if I want to see folks beat up on cows, I'll just go to the neighbors, and they won't charge me for a ticket.\" \n\nMy Dad believed in animal rights without using the word.\n\nOn the other hand, the uber-elitism, bad manners, hyperbole and downright lying of PETA makes me think that they are bad guys. I wouldn't put it past PETA to have set this up. They're sure as hell milking it.\n\nAnd then there's the Iditarod Trail Committee. What a bunch of bozos! I believe that most mushers are in fact supporters of animal rights. Go Dallas.",

Paradox of thrift is still a valid concept. Take a yuuuge mortgage to flip a house is different that someone buying a house to live in. House flippers don't need washing machines and furnishings- which generate secondary spending. And no, this is not trickle down economics. That is a different thing.\n\nWe had the business leaders running the US Treasury for too long. It didn't end well for the average family or middle class worker. Watch the \"big short\" or \"Capitalism not a love story\".  Rich simple got richer. \n\nIf you are going to incur debt to increase GDP, put it in the hands of people who will spend all of it within local economies on tangible goods and services.",

Sounds more like an angry lashing out.  But, hey, go for it.  Wreck your credit rating.  That'll teach them!!",

I think she had a majority support from her team - most were recruited by her and why wouldn't you want someone who is experienced on both sides of the bench on your team.  The BC Liberals only have a handful that served more 16 years in government. Clark did a lot more in six and half years than all the BC NDP did in a decade of governance.  Moreover, unlike the BC NDP, Clark actually knows that a party can only truly move on when the old leader is no longer hanging around - you can say she was push or whatever, but have a look at all the old leaders that BC NDP have kicking around - Carole James and Adrian Dix - you can't even get rid of them and they want folks to believe that they are somehow different.  Clark's resignation is probably a real loss as you have one less experience member of opposition to hold the BC NDP to account.",

Discipline must be in balance with the bad behavior, but also sufficient to get the kid's attention that some behavior is simply unacceptable.  I see a generation of emotional of screwed up snowflakes who  are  impervious to the feelings of others, who were never spanked.  They have no concept of the limits of their own freedoms vis--a-vis the rights of others. Some kids need to be spanked  for their own good.  It is a preventive measure against escalating abuses by the kids themselves.  It tells kids \" The line is drawn here\".    Sensitive discussion of bad behavior with an 8 year old is a fool's game.",

He was the perfect actor with a genuine smile and personality that made him a favorite for the job of President.  On the other hand, he was the perfect shill for the conservative side of the political spectrum. He single handedly closed down the majority of mental institutions in this country that eventually led to the homeless crisis we experience today.  And, more than any other politician in my lifetime,  he was responsible for destroying a large number of unions that  led to the dismemberment of America's Middle Class.  Reaganomics and his trickle down theory of wealth generation failed to rejuvenate the Middle Class over a long period of time.\n\nHe served as the perfect front man for the hidden power behind the scenes in the world of conservatism, as did George W Bush, resulting in a ruling oligarchy of billionaires that run the country today.   Democracy?",

Also,  I suspect that he is making a mistake in his personal attacks on JT,  since the PM has always acknowledged that he has been very fortunate financially.  Are we to think that any wealthy person should not be in politics?  Unless there is an accusation that he has somehow done something illegal,  then my guess is that most Canadians will see these attacks as cheap and personal.  Also, from what I understand family trusts are a completely different vehicle from professional corporations and the tax system is not at all the same,  so the changes cannot be identically applied to both vehicles.",

In the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, I hope to see celibate women ordained *before* the celibacy requirement is relaxed.  The numbers of priests would double overnight, and the vocations shortage can thus be alleviated in the short term.  This is the way I see the situation unfolding:\n\nReligious Patriarchy ~ Annotated Chronology of Key Events\nhttp://pelicanweb.org/CCC.TOB.html#CHRONOLOGY\n\nThe patriarchal priesthood of the Old Law is a yoke that is not easy, and a burden that is not light.  It is by no means normative for the sacramental priesthood of the New Law, and is now obsolete and utterly irrelevant.  As far as I know, there is no dogmatic impediment; so, why not?  The pluses and minuses of a married priesthood can be reconsidered in due time; but   further delaying the ordination of celibate women is to perpetuate an ancient error devoid of revealed truth.",

They were preparing to sell, an offer they couldn't resist. I suppose to Japanese. Later I came back trying to find this charming residence from the ocean side.

By reverting the tax back to the shareholders thru taxing dividends only at the individual level, the IRS gets the money. Shareholders, who many believe have the income to invest( read as \"rich\" are the ones getting taxed. By eliminating most deductions (mortgage interest & taxes, medical) but getting a larger standard deduction will simplify taxes.\n\nAs to your claim of corporate interference, if politicians (who have the real power because of the force of gov't) can't shakedown corporations by giving carve outs to them, that power is reduced to both. As we are seeing today, the GOP establishment does not wish to reduce the size of gov't, only redistribute it to their own cronies. When the Dems return to power, they will reward their cronies.\n\nCorps. can also hire more people (taxpayers) with money not being paid as taxes. \n\nIts a win-win-win.",

I confronted that pettiness and it made you rather unhappy.  I think the use of one's real identity instills a degree of accountability which is missing with anonymous posts.  Your display of condescension blends very well with your pedantics.  \n\nMy posts have addressed the specifics of the use of language and the spelling of the two words you describe as \"errors.\"  I have pointed out that such usage is interchangeable with your AP standard spelling and is no big deal.  It doesn't alter the meaning of the story in any way.  \n\nIf you're a prof in Oregon's J-school it must be a real joy to be in your class.  Again, in my opinion, your petty pedantics are a bore.  \n\ngood-bye and have a pleasant evening,  Gary Crum",

It's just not right to waste so much money while treating hard-working Canadians so poorly. The working poor, for example, cannot affford prescriptions, do not have benefits yet are forced to pay for Canada;s laughable $7K/person medicare program which delivers only $4,000 in value at best and no pharmacare.

When you're that young and feel like you don't have anywhere to go, then hanging out with \"older tough\" guys can seem like the perfect solution. You feel wanted, special, safe and you have a place to stay. At that age that can seem like love. Sounds like she got in over her head and is mixed up in an ugly situation. She's very involved as you said, she probably was very scared. Hopefully this will be her wake up call to change her life and get her shit together. When you don't have a safe home or on the streets, staying in school and being successful in school is extremely difficult. I wish her the best of luck. This \"thug\" wanna be gang lifestyle ends 2 ways, dead or in jail. They tend to die very young.",

As Rachel Notley's government is ushered out, I wonder if these twits will regret the lost opportunity to compromise with a government that seemed willing to meet them half way.  Probably not... which is why I remain completely disgusted with the lot of them.",

Those with significant cognitive disabilities might be in a life skills class (although they still take electives and lunch with other students), and those with severe emotional disturbances or who have proven to be repeatedly violent may be put at Whaley or other specialized programs. But federal law requires the least restrictive environment, and for most kids who have relatively minor disabilities, they are mainstreamed into a more inclusive environment. Which is great for many but not every student. To move a student to a more restrictive environment is a very cumbersome process, particularly if the parent objects. \n\nOther districts use more self contained classes but ASD is big on inclusion. For many that's good, but it isn't beneficial to everyone who has a disability or sometimes even other students. It just depends.",

Mulroney sold out our manufacturing sector and burdened us with GST.  The answer is simple, American oil has been against Canadian pipelines and funds groups like those protesting in Ottawa. It has nothing to do with not enough carbon tax. Protestors should be protesting the GST, the real problem facing ordinary folks. If the GST is so great, why doesn't the USA have one? Because it is grossly unfair. After tax income is ours, not theirs to poach. GST kills jobs here.",

And they distilled all of Prop 8 down to one issue - their bottom line, while forgetting that the revised Muni ordinance also greatly increases the availability of accessible cabs for people with disabilities, increases penalties for unlicensed drivers, and requires permit owners to operate a minimum number of hours per year.\n\nAlso:  Yellow Cab and Checker are currently charging below the max threshold they're allowed to by ordinance ($3/ flag, $3/mile). The Yes on Prop 8 Admin  (who is probably closely connected to the ATPOA) made some veiled threats that both dispatch companies would increase to the max allowed fare if their repeal efforts failed.  It works out to 10-20% increase if they do so.",

The most stalwart defenders of slavery through American history were Democrats, who later wrote Jim Crow laws to preserve what they could of it. They also fought to prevent passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The claims you echoed are the classic Stalinist/Alinskyite (yes, I said Stalinist) tactic of accusing your opponent of doing what you are doing while claiming to be doing the opposite to mask what you are doing. Those people who attacked Trump supporters and protested against him during the election campaign were all paid by rich Liberals, who are today funding the \"not my president\" protests in different cities.

There are 2 types of tax credits.  \"refundable\" and \"non refundable\"\nIn the case of a non refundable tax credit, you can take the credit up until your liability is 0 in which case you have maxed it out, no matter the amount.  \n\nA refundable tax credit will be refundable to you.   Meaning if your tax liability is 0 and you have additional tax credit that money is refunded to you ...

House flippers don't need washing machines and furnishings- which generate secondary spending. And no, this is not trickle down economics.
