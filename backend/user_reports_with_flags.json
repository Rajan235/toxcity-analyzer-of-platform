It takes humility to admit you were wrong about something and try to establish a better environment for everyone - take the Andrew Loku situation, which BLM continues to profess as being a \"murder\" by the men and women that keep us safe every day and put their lives on the line. It was a tragic event without a doubt, but all facts point to proper measures taken by the officers on scene (not to mention the fact that two officers had picked him up an hour prior to the incident and drove him home).

I think she had a majority support from her team - most were recruited by her and why wouldn't you want someone who is experienced on both sides of the bench on your team.  The BC Liberals only have a handful that served more 16 years in government. Clark did a lot more in six and half years than all the BC NDP did in a decade of governance.  Moreover, unlike the BC NDP, Clark actually knows that a party can only truly move on when the old leader is no longer hanging around - you can say she was push or whatever, but have a look at all the old leaders that BC NDP have kicking around - Carole James and Adrian Dix - you can't even get rid of them and they want folks to believe that they are somehow different.  Clark's resignation is probably a real loss as you have one less experience member of opposition to hold the BC NDP to account.",

After discussing the Oregon Public Records Law, we were all told:  \"Do not put anything on the computer that you don't want to see above the fold in the Oregonian.\"  (There were still big thick newspapers back then.) \n\nWhen I was first granted a Security Clearance, part of the three-hour interview and briefing was to point out all the bad things that could happen to my country and to me personally if I revealed Classified information.  \n\nEveryone involved at the DNC (two Congresswomen in charge), Podesta, and Hillary have all had the same briefings or the equivalent.  \n\nArrogance, hubris and stupidity were the main ingredients for this bit of political theater.",

Those with significant cognitive disabilities might be in a life skills class (although they still take electives and lunch with other students), and those with severe emotional disturbances or who have proven to be repeatedly violent may be put at Whaley or other specialized programs. But federal law requires the least restrictive environment, and for most kids who have relatively minor disabilities, they are mainstreamed into a more inclusive environment. Which is great for many but not every student. To move a student to a more restrictive environment is a very cumbersome process, particularly if the parent objects. \n\nOther districts use more self contained classes but ASD is big on inclusion. For many that's good, but it isn't beneficial to everyone who has a disability or sometimes even other students. It just depends.",

Mulroney sold out our manufacturing sector and burdened us with GST.  The answer is simple, American oil has been against Canadian pipelines and funds groups like those protesting in Ottawa. It has nothing to do with not enough carbon tax. Protestors should be protesting the GST, the real problem facing ordinary folks. If the GST is so great, why doesn't the USA have one? Because it is grossly unfair. After tax income is ours, not theirs to poach. GST kills jobs here.",

And they distilled all of Prop 8 down to one issue - their bottom line, while forgetting that the revised Muni ordinance also greatly increases the availability of accessible cabs for people with disabilities, increases penalties for unlicensed drivers, and requires permit owners to operate a minimum number of hours per year.\n\nAlso:  Yellow Cab and Checker are currently charging below the max threshold they're allowed to by ordinance ($3/ flag, $3/mile). The Yes on Prop 8 Admin  (who is probably closely connected to the ATPOA) made some veiled threats that both dispatch companies would increase to the max allowed fare if their repeal efforts failed.  It works out to 10-20% increase if they do so.",

You mentioned slavery and Jim Crow as if Conservatives wanted to re-impose them. That is pure rubbish. The most stalwart defenders of slavery through American history were Democrats, who later wrote Jim Crow laws to preserve what they could of it. They also fought to prevent passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The claims you echoed are the classic Stalinist/Alinskyite (yes, I said Stalinist) tactic of accusing your opponent of doing what you are doing while claiming to be doing the opposite to mask what you are doing. Those people who attacked Trump supporters and protested against him during the election campaign were all paid by rich Liberals, who are today funding the \"not my president\" protests in different cities. So I wonder if you have any idea how truly evil the Liberalism you defend has become.",
