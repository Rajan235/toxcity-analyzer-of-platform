Cook was welcomed with open arms because Hawaiians and Polynesians generally were voyagers par excellence.  They celebrated voyagers and made them feel at home when they made landfall.  How else could their ancestors have settled every landmass over 1/3 of the globe?  Xenophobia would have been counter-productive to this enterprise, don't you think?  Kamehameha actively sought alliance with King George of England, and he and others spoke of themselves as men of Brittanee.  Through much of the 19th century Hawai`i had one of the greatest rates of literacy in the world, and the local newspapers were filled with stories about goings-on around the world.  These were some of the least xenophobic people in the world for a long time.\n\n(continued)"

A person who is anti-choice can't possibly advance the agenda for women. Anti-choice does not mean pro-abortion per se...it means supporting a women with an unintended pregnancy regardless of the option she chooses...terminating the pregnancy, or continuing the pregnancy and keeping the child or putting the baby up for adoption."

It takes humility to admit you were wrong about something and try to establish a better environment for everyone - take the Andrew Loku situation, which BLM continues to profess as being a \"murder\" by the men and women that keep us safe every day and put their lives on the line. It was a tragic event without a doubt, but all facts point to proper measures taken by the officers on scene (not to mention the fact that two officers had picked him up an hour prior to the incident and drove him home). How it was a racially charged \"murder\", beats me...aggressive DEMANDS don't stimulate fruitful dialogue. We are Canadians, let's act civil and inclusive...exclusion gets us no where"

Paradox of thrift is still a valid concept. Take a yuuuge mortgage to flip a house is different that someone buying a house to live in. House flippers don't need washing machines and furnishings- which generate secondary spending. And no, this is not trickle down economics. That is a different thing.\n\nWe had the business leaders running the US Treasury for too long. It didn't end well for the average family or middle class worker. Watch the \"big short\" or \"Capitalism not a love story\".  Rich simple got richer. \n\nIf you are going to incur debt to increase GDP, put it in the hands of people who will spend all of it within local economies on tangible goods and services."

I think she had a majority support from her team - most were recruited by her and why wouldn't you want someone who is experienced on both sides of the bench on your team.  The BC Liberals only have a handful that served more 16 years in government. Clark did a lot more in six and half years than all the BC NDP did in a decade of governance.  Moreover, unlike the BC NDP, Clark actually knows that a party can only truly move on when the old leader is no longer hanging around - you can say she was push or whatever, but have a look at all the old leaders that BC NDP have kicking around - Carole James and Adrian Dix - you can't even get rid of them and they want folks to believe that they are somehow different.  Clark's resignation is probably a real loss as you have one less experience member of opposition to hold the BC NDP to account."

He single handedly closed down the majority of mental institutions in this country that eventually led to the homeless crisis we experience today.

Are we to think that any wealthy person should not be in politics?  Unless there is an accusation that he has somehow done something illegal,  then my guess is that most Canadians will see these attacks as cheap and personal.

This is the way I see the situation unfolding:\n\nReligious Patriarchy ~ Annotated Chronology of Key Events\nhttp://pelicanweb.org/CCC.TOB.html#CHRONOLOGY\n\nThe patriarchal priesthood of the Old Law is a yoke that is not easy, and a burden that is not light.  It is by no means normative for the sacramental priesthood of the New Law, and is now obsolete and utterly irrelevant.  As far as I know, there is no dogmatic impediment; so, why not?  The pluses and minuses of a married priesthood can be reconsidered in due time; but   further delaying the ordination of celibate women is to perpetuate an ancient error devoid of revealed truth."

Shareholders, who many believe have the income to invest( read as \"rich\" are the ones getting taxed. By eliminating most deductions (mortgage interest & taxes, medical) but getting a larger standard deduction will simplify taxes.\n\nAs to your claim of corporate interference, if politicians (who have the real power because of the force of gov't) can't shakedown corporations by giving carve outs to them, that power is reduced to both. As we are seeing today, the GOP establishment does not wish to reduce the size of gov't, only redistribute it to their own cronies.

There are 2 types of tax credits.  \"refundable\" and \"non refundable\"\nIn the case of a non refundable tax credit, you can take the credit up until your liability is 0 in which case you have maxed it out, no matter the amount.  \n\nA refundable tax credit will be refundable to you.   Meaning if your tax liability is 0 and you have additional tax credit that money is refunded to you ... (meaning you get money \"back\" that  you never paid.  \n\nPlease educate yourself before correcting others.\n  \nfor more information please go to \n\nhttps://www.irs.com/articles/refundable-vs-non-refundable-tax-credits"

There will be no growing the economy after the reset of a crash if our huge per capita Gov. just continues to suck the life out of any possible economic growth. Small Gov. everybody wins if they invest during the crash. Big Gov. anybody who invests hard money even when properties are giveaway prices is foolish. It's too bad Gov. grew well funded and well manned for 40 years on big oil money. It has matured into something working Alaskans neither want nor can afford."

It's ridiculous that hard-working Canadians with modest incomes can't afford to buy a home but are taxed so surplus employees can earn twice and much, take up to 100 days off per year and enjoy up to 13 weeks of vacation (ie the TTC, other governments levels too).\n\nThose on modest incomes lose 25% of their pay due to taxes, cpp and Ei. It's just not right to waste so much money while treating hard-working Canadians so poorly. The working poor, for example, cannot affford prescriptions, do not have benefits yet are forced to pay for Canada;s laughable $7K/person medicare program which delivers only $4,000 in value at best and no pharmacare. Cruel misgovernance and waste must end along with all convenient politically minded  spending.\n\nOverpaid excess emergency and hospital workers work 12-hour shifts for convenience, endangering the public and delivering poor quality error-riddled service when tired."

When you're that young and feel like you don't have anywhere to go, then hanging out with \"older tough\" guys can seem like the perfect solution. You feel wanted, special, safe and you have a place to stay. At that age that can seem like love. Sounds like she got in over her head and is mixed up in an ugly situation. She's very involved as you said, she probably was very scared. Hopefully this will be her wake up call to change her life and get her shit together. When you don't have a safe home or on the streets, staying in school and being successful in school is extremely difficult. I wish her the best of luck. This \"thug\" wanna be gang lifestyle ends 2 ways, dead or in jail. They tend to die very young."

You mentioned slavery and Jim Crow as if Conservatives wanted to re-impose them. That is pure rubbish. The most stalwart defenders of slavery through American history were Democrats, who later wrote Jim Crow laws to preserve what they could of it. They also fought to prevent passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The claims you echoed are the classic Stalinist/Alinskyite (yes, I said Stalinist) tactic of accusing your opponent of doing what you are doing while claiming to be doing the opposite to mask what you are doing. Those people who attacked Trump supporters and protested against him during the election campaign were all paid by rich Liberals, who are today funding the \"not my president\" protests in different cities. So I wonder if you have any idea how truly evil the Liberalism you defend has become."
